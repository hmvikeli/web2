<h2>Safety and friendly operations</h2>
<p1>Passengers in taxi industry were having
challenges to report them about the
transport industry.<br>
Many people treated so badly which led the media industry
to intervene by broadcasting.<br> Reporting such stories they
discovered from places where taxis are operating.<br>
It became our duty to be peace makers as responsible
citizens of the country to make sure we do play our part</p1>
<br>
<p2>To represent all passengers from local, long distance and
cross border passengers.<br>
To protect human rights and remember that all rights have
responsibilities too.<br>To encourage clear effective communication all the time.<br>
To educate the younger people to obey the rules of the taxi
industry without looking at the
educational status of operators.<br>
To encourage people to continue operating without being
sexists, racists, tribalists and being neutral all the
time.<br>
Encourage gender equality and LGBTQ to all levels. <br> Perseverance during rush and waiting moments. <br>
Commuters, taxi operators (drivers, Marshalls andpatrollers) to have understanding of how important it is to
work together peacefully.<br> Give clear goals and how they contribute objective of
Promoting positive prevention</p2>
